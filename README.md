## UX 
### Project Goals 

The overall objective of this project is to give users information about a pub and restaurant located in Wells, England. This is a history rich pub that used to be an old city jail. 
It is aimed towards both tourists and locals alike, who are looking for something to eat, drink or just have a look at the old building. There are also rooms upstairs offering 
lovely accommodation. This website should be easy to navigate, while aiming to provide users with everything they need to know about this old pub in an easily
navigable manner. With all of this in mind, it should encourage users to go and check out the pub for themselves. 

### User Goals:
* Informative website that serves to provide all needed information about the pub, for example food, drink, opening times and accommdation availability.
* Well placed calls to action which inspire users to get in touch with the pub and continue their experience offline
* Ability to send a message via a contact form for ease of access
* Location map which makes it easy for users to find
* Use the website across all screen sizes, from desktop to mobile. Fully responsive design.
